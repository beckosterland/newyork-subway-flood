# NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY: VULNERABILITY TO RISING SEA-LEVELS, FLOODING AND CLIMATE CHANGE
Course project for "Programming for Geospatial Technologies" using geospatial Python libraries to examine NYC subway station entrances that will be effected by projected floodplains of the future.

The project uses several python libraries for the processing, analysis and visualization of data relating to subway stations entrances (underground, elevated), neighborhood tabulation areas (NTA),
and past & projected floodplain data for the city of New York. Libraries used include:
- Pandas
- GeoPandas
- fiona
- shapely
- numpy
- bokeh
- mplleaflet
- folium

The python scripts also provide functions to automate the creation of consistently styled maps using user-input data.

Please consult the report for more information on the methods used and results.
